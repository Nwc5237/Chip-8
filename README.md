# Chip-8
A Chip-8 virtual machine written in C as a first emulation project.

This semester in my computer organization and design class we used Xilinx Vivado
to write a Verilog implementation of the MIPS architecture. I thought that it was
really cool to be able to design and implement a CPU that could actually run code,
and I wanted to do more with hardware stuff like that. In the past I've used 
software for emulation like the PCSX2 and found it interesting that someone could
write code that acts the same as hardware, so at a hackathon this past fall I went
to a workshop called "Introduction to Emulation." At the workshop the presenter said
that the Chip-8 was a good way to get into emulation, so I decided to try it out.
